Ghost behavior:
	Common:
		3 ghosts start in box, 1 ghost starts in maze
		Nothing can ever re-enter the box
		When ghosts leave the box/start outside, they start by going left
		At the start of the level, and when Pacman dies, the ghosts get reset
		
		Ghost movement is determined by a target tile that the ghosts choose (doesn't have to be accessible)
		All ghosts follow the same movement AI to get to the tile, but each ghost chooses tiles differently
		
		3 modes of ghost movement:
			Chase:
				Pacman's position is used in determining target tile
				Normal mode
			Scatter:
				Ghosts go to predetermined FINAL tiles at each corner of board
					Pink: Top left
					Red: top right
					Yellow: bottom left
					blue: bottom right
			Frightened:
				No target tile, pseudorandom turns at intersections
				Happens when Pacman eats big dot
		
		Modes switch between Chase and Scatter on a fixed time interval
		timer is reset at beginning of level and when pacman dies
		timer is paused when in Frightened mode
		
		Timer (first level) (in real game, changes with each level, but I might not do that):
		Scatter (7 sec)
		Chase (20 sec)
		Scatter (7)
		Chase (20)
		Scatter (5)
		Chase (20)
		Scatter (5)
		Chase (permanent)
		
		Ghost movement AI:
			Each time enters a tile, chooses a target tile, looks at target location and own location 
				and decides where to go next
			Ghosts can NEVER reverse direction (180 degree turn), except when switching modes S/C (then its required)
		
		Pathing AI:
			When entering an intersection tile, checks distance of each adjacent tile to target (in straight line)
			Goes into whichever tile has shortest distance to target
			If 2 paths are same distance, chooses in priority: up > left > down > right (but it will never go right)
			At the two intersections directly above the doorframe to box, and the two next directly below them,
				ghosts will never turn upwards except from mode change direction reversal or in Frightened mode
		
		Frightened Mode AI:
			Ghosts use a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to pick a way to turn at each intersection 
			when frightened. 
			The PRNG generates an pseudo-random memory address to read the last few bits from. 
			These bits are translated into the direction a frightened ghost must first try. If a wall blocks 
			the chosen direction, the ghost then attempts the remaining directions in this order: 
			up, left, down, and right, until a passable direction is found. The PRNG gets reset with an 
			identical seed value every new level and every new life, causing predictable results.
		
		Ghost specific AI:
			Blinky (Red): starts outside box
				Target tile is Pacman's current tile
				At 2 milestones of dots eaten, speed increases by 5%
					at 20 dots left
					at 10 dots left
			
			Pinky (Pink): 1st to leave box (immediately)
				Target tile is 4 tiles in front of Pacman in direction Pacman is going
			
			Inky (Teal): 2nd to leave box (after Pinky leaves and 30 dots eaten)
				Complex target tile calculation using Pacman's direction and Blinky's location
					Tile X is 2 tiles in front of Pacman in direction of his movement
					Take vector from Blinky (Red) to Tile X, and double length of vector
					Inky's target tile is the tile that vector ends on
			
			Clyde (Yellow): 3rd/last to leave box (after Inky leaves and 60 more dots eaten)
				2 modes:
					When > 8 tiles away from Pacman, uses Blinky (Red) AI
					When <= 8 tiles away from Pacman, uses Scatter mode AI
